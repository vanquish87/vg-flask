            <p>Transportation is a key pillar for any economy to grow n sustain & when we talk about India with vast Highways & Train track network we should not forget the geography of India. We have such a long & beautiful coast-line not to mention a location on Globe which connects Eastern globe to western counter-part.
            </p>
            <p>This geography has created another line of Monopolistic line of business with longevity which is <b>Coastal Shipping Transportation</b>.

            <p>Shreyas promoter understands business very well & I find them focussed towards creating wealth for shareholders.</p>
            
            <p>These guys are constantly upping their game as they recently bought 3 more Vessels (Ships) at <i>Kude ke bhaav</i> using <i>ships ki market ki mandi</i> & increased their capacity.
            </p>
            
            <p><i>Kaise</i> let's check out...
            </p>

            <h2>SWOT Analysis :</h2>

            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>9 Vessels with average age of 20 years.
                </li>
                <li>Shreyas handles almost 60% of India's Container Cargo <i class="fa fa-trophy" style="color:blue"></i>.
                </li>
                <li>Dominance in Western Coastline (WCC and PIX-1).
                </li>
                <li>Remuneration policy of Shreyas Shipping & Logistics are investor friendly & promoter seems to be working in favour of Shareholders.
                </li>
                <li>Shreyas has replaced two vessels with higher capacity n added three new vessels when prices of newer vessels are at historic low levels. This shows the intention to scale & smartness of promoter & promoter group.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Efforts needed to gain business on east coastline.
                </li>
                <li>Dry docking period of 15-30 days needed to put each vessel on rest & manage risk which gives somewhat inconsistency in business.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>opportunities</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Coastal shipping presently accounts for only 7% of overall cargo movement in India.
                </li>
                <li>Coastal shipping is cheaper & scalable way of cargo movement which needs to be promoted & is being promoted by govt. of India as we speak.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>threats</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Sharp fluctuations inr-dollar rate is always a risk.
                </li>
                <li>A major threat being availability of adequate bunkering facilities.
                </li>
                <li>Inadequate bunkering infrastructure at most minor/intermediate ports acts as an hindrance to coastal shipping.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            
            <br>

            <h2>Business Verdict :</h2>
            
            <p>The promoter is now aggressive with expansions but Howe Robinson Container Index is flat to downward & hence cargo shipment charges are at very low level. I expect this condition to recover as Howe Robinson Container Index being cyclical in nature & we are at almost bottom of cycle.
            </p>
