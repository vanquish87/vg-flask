        <div id="intro">
          
          <p>What's up dost,</p>
          <p>Today if you switch on News channels only to find macro issues or politicians all around. You see politician or filmi people hogging all the coverage. It is excruciating watching these prop actors day in day out & irony is that we pay for newspaper as well as tv to watch this circus everyday  <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #5bc0de"></i>.
          </p>
          
          <p>& If you are a fan of investing or Mr. markets you will end up seeing Tech companies hogging the limelights all the time like their daily chores is a need to know for all.
          </p>
          <p>Stupid things happening all around. I mean what is the point of these people/things in our life ? Are we really so concerned with their well being ? 
          </p>
          <p>Where are those good days when things were as they looked. Everything is a scheme, you go to mall & they will con you by giving a 'FREE' card  while you shop collecting some stupid points tricking you to shop more. 
          </p>
          <p>Petrol pumps, e-commerce websites, cashbacks, scheme points... endless trash.
          </p>
          <p>Then a simpleton ends up bombarded by spam SMSs & emails all day long. It's hard to ignore everything everyday.</p>

          <p>If you step back a little & look at your life as a 3<sup>rd</sup> person only to realize that we get <b>Conned</b> day-in & day-out.
          </p>
          
          <p>1 of the biggest Cons are Stock-brokers. These creatures have mastered the art by providing you with jaw-dropping technology for <i>sattebaaji</i>. It's hard to ignore quick rich & fun schemes.... RIGHT ?</p>
          
          <p>But I am very proud to share an exit of a phenomenal Value pick that was given on valueguyz.com which not only proved to be best ever Value pick at valueguyz.com but also proves that :

        <p>GM Breweries  deals in activities of manufacturing and marketing of Alcoholic Beverages; such as Country Liquor (CL) and Indian made Foreign Liquor (IMFL).
        </p>
        <p>In 2015 due to some <a href="https://scroll.in/article/735705/why-did-90-mumbaikars-die-drinking-cheap-hooch-even-though-legal-liquor-costs-only-rs-45-a-quarter" target="_blank"> fatalaties</a> related to people dying by drinking local poisonous <i>Daaru</i> Maharashtra government intervened started curbing them with immediate effect.
        </p>
        <p>This whole situation turned out to be blessing in disguise for GM breweries as well as for us making way for scaling business as demand for IMFL increased in Maharashtra state.
        </p>
        
        <p>It gave phenomenal returns but has incurred almost none expenses (just an entry & an exit) and has clearly outperformed Nifty ie, 4.58% return in same period. 
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <h4><b> 538%</b> tax free returns <i class="fa fa-beer" style="color:green"></i> in 2 years is the best performance of any Value pick given by valuguyz till date.
          </h4>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>I hope <i> aap yeh samjhe</i> that we are not magician but Intelligent investors who are just avoiding sattabaaji.
