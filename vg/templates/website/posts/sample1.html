        <div id="intro">

          <p>Hi Dost,</p>
          
          <p>What a phenomenal year was 2017. We together scaled new heights just look at our performance.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <h4>Last 1 year returns :</h4>
            <h4><a href="http://www.valueguyz.com/pages/valuepicks-multibagger-vgex-performance" target="_blank">VGEX</a> : 61%</h4>
            <h4>S&P Nifty (Mr. Market) : 30%</h4>
            <h4>Sattebaaj : - 100% (Lost all of it)</h4>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Do me a favor go out with your family/partner/Gf/Bf or friends and celebrate <i class="fa fa-beer" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#34af23"></i> a crazy fucking 31<sup>st</sup> Dec as you say bid adieu to 2017. You deserve it as the results mentioned above believe it or not are 99.9 percentile results. Go cherish being of ValueGuy, I know I will <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#FFA500"></i></p>
          
          <p>Now let's talk some bond market stuff n hang in there as it might sound boring or go above your head but trust me you are ready for some of these important macro economic dose.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <h4>India's fiscal deficit at the end of November breached the target and touched 112 per cent of the budget estimate for 2017-18.</h4>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>It has happened because of fuck ups of Govt. of India doing GST (Indirect taxes) implementation n getting lower tax collections & also lower dividends issued by RBI because of lower lending which was obvious because of bank's liability side was flooded by liquidity after Demonetization drive of our beloved government.
          </p>
          <p>These are minor hiccups as concerned with Macros of our Country which goes into depth if you talk to hits taken by common man. But as a ValueGuyz as we were confident throughout the year & it turned out really well for us.
          </p>
          <p>Now my common sense says this information led to another action which is....</p>
          <blockquote>
            <h4>Indian bond yields jump in Dec after govt announces additional borrowing.</h4>
          </blockquote>
          <p><i>Oh balle balle!</i> this means RBI will print more money out of thin air (Yes you read it correctly our currency has no base) & sooner or later it will end up in our Mr. Market to further fuel its Uptrend.</p>
          
          <p>Meanwhile <i>Saat samundar paar</i>....</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <h4>US Fed's policymaking committee raised the benchmark short-term federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.25 to 1.5 percent in December</h4>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The Fed raised rates three times this year and five times since it took the rate to zero during the financial crisis.</p>
          <p><i>Oh teri</i> this info means that <i>angrez</i> will soon take away their invested or traded money back.</p>
          <p>But wait.... On the flip side this is happening.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <h4>The dollar $ index has dropped more than 9% this year, putting it on track for its biggest annual slide since 2003.</h4>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Dollar has fallen on worries that Trump would not succeed in implementing other programs he campaigned on. This is reason why <i>angrez</i> won't go back easily as they are questioning their own system.
          </p>
          <p>Right now they are bound to stay invested & in fact bring in more more $ into India.</p>
          
          
          <p>In concise what I am trying to tell you is that best years for our VGEX are yet to come. I am ecstatic when I share with you that we are very well positioned to make greater gains as we are creating our legacies.
          </p>
          <p>I know you're smart enough to stick with me and VG for many many years to come... after all we all are 99.9 percentilers <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#FFA500"></i>
          </p>
          
          
          <p>Hopping back on agenda let's move ahead n pick up another amazing business as we slowly but surely inch towards our goals <i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o" aria-hidden="true" style="color:blue"></i>

        <h2>About Business :</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <h4>Sometimes system wants you to hack it.</h4>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Today I am in a good mood & will let you peek into my mind a bit more. I consider myself as a more of hacker (<i>Jugaadu</i>) then anything else. Ask anyone who knows me n they will tell you can Jasmeet is natural contrarion & rebellious n he always in search of smart ways to get things done.
        </p>
        <p>Enough of bragging... don't mind it <i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o" aria-hidden="true" style="color:blue"></i></p>
        <p>This month's Premium pick is a more of hacking of value picking. We are not gonna discuss details of working of the business but I will show you some of honed skill of a hacked investing.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What does it do ?</h2>
        <p>Basically Vardhman holdings is an investment company which holds stocks. It has ditto similar working style of the fund I manage (Not gonna mention its name here :P)</p>
        
        <h3>Why it's a Hack</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Market Capitalization of Vardhman Holdings Ltd. is around <i class="fa fa-inr" aria-hidden="true"></i> 1600 Crore and yet actually holds around <i class="fa fa-inr" aria-hidden="true"></i> 3500 Crore + (today's value) worth of equity and liquid funds.
            </li>
            <li>Zero debt since it is a purely an investment vehicle.
            </li>
            <li>Out of <i class="fa fa-inr" aria-hidden="true"></i> 3500 Crore  worth of equity around 90% is holdings of <a href="https://nseindia.com/live_market/dynaContent/live_watch/get_quote/GetQuote.jsp?symbol=VTL" target="_blank"> Vardhman Textile Ltd.</a>. So essentially you are getting deep deep bargain into buying a monopolistic n reputed company of India.
            </li>
            <li>Vardhman Holdings has grown around 25 times in last 10 years. Leading by example of awesome fund managing <i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o" aria-hidden="true" style="color:blue"></i>
            </li>
            <li>Since its a just an investment company hence no work at all hence only 3 employees needed to run this mammoth. Don't you just love a lean machine like this.
            </li>
            <li>Promoter hardly drawing a salary of <i class="fa fa-inr" aria-hidden="true"></i> 14 Lc when infact he can legally under companies act draw around <i class="fa fa-inr" aria-hidden="true"></i> 20 Crore. It shouts clearly that they run a really ethical fund managing. At this point I in am in <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true" style="color:red"></i>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>Acrylic Fibre is mainly used for clothes and Acrylic Yarn produced from Acrylic Fibre is warm to manufacture Sweaters, Scarves,T-Shirts, Kids Clothes, Mufflers, Jogging Suits, Socks etc.</p>
        
        <p>Our Pick ie, Pasupati Acrylon is a B2B (Business to business) company manufacturing AF ie, acrylic fibres.
        </p>
        <p>Pasupati Acrylon has a plant in Moradabad (UP) area where it has installed capacity of more than 40,000 TPA of AFs</p>
        
        <br>


        <h2>SWOT Analysis :</h2>

        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li>Acrylic Fibre by nature is a high margin business and Pasupati has its all turnover coming from it till date.
            </li>
            <li>Pasupati Acrylon commenced production of Cast Polypropylene Film (CPP) from 1<sup>st</sup> September, 2017.
            </li>
            <li>With shareholders approval last year Mr. Jain ie, promoter of Pasupati Acrylon has started diversifying with CPP 1<sup>st</sup> in line.
            </li>
            <li>CPP films are transparent cast polypropylene films designed to offer high performance, great appearance and easy converting for flexible packaging and other applications.
            </li>
            <li>CPP is growing in popularity among many areas as a more attractive packaging material against polyethylene. It is again a good margin product and would add significant profits into Pasupati Acrylon.
            </li>
            <li>Pasupati increased production of AF well in advance of winters. With this year's winters coming in early would ensure higher turnover as well as profits for the business.
            </li>
            <li>Promoter is inclined towards value creations & business has excellent remuneration <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true" style="color:blue"></i> policies. I am happy to mention that they are very welcoming to analysts.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Not tied up to big brands likes of Shoppers Stop, Westside where demand is heavy and consistent.
            </li>
            <li>Pasupati Acrylon is not inclined towards R&D and are at mercy of others innovation to take industry forward. This doesn't look good for very long term view.
            </li>
            
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>opportunities</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Major raw material in AF production is ACN (AcryloNitrile) which is a by-product of Crude oil. Lower stable prices of Crude can help AF industry to innovate low cost solutions for carpet, blanket industry.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>threats</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Warm weather forecasts for winters poses a huge threat for production of Acrylic fibres.
            </li>
            <li>Pasupati Acrylon exports 30% + of its production. Sharp fluctuations inr-dollar rate is always a risk.
            </li>
            <li>Commissioning of AF manufacturers of China in 2016 has raised a threat on exports since it raised competition in international markets.
            </li>
            <li>Sharp volatility in crude oil prices poses quite a problem in importing raw material ie ACN (AcryloNitrile).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Business Verdict :</h2>

        <p>Being a <i>Lala</i> company at heart, Pasupati Acrylon has recorded strong growth in past and passion of Mr. Vineet Jain ie, promoter for business is admirable.
        </p>
        <p>I am very optimistic with nature of working, expansion into CPP of Pasupati. These guys are working in manufacturing of high margin products ie, AF and recently CPP.
        </p>
        <p>Even in worst case scenario Pasupati Acrylon is bound to increase turnover and profitability over coming years.</p>


        <blockquote>
          <p><b>Pasupati Acrylon Ltd</b> is a Multibagger stock in India with unique products ie, Acrylic fibres (AF) and Cast Polypropylene Film (CPP). ValueGuyz this stock is a definite premium value pick to consider for your research.
